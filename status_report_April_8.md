We have set up a database with several layers of caching, where some data is stored on our own server and some data is stored on the TuftsDiningData API server. We have created an object that contains a comparison between our two dining halls, and created a route so that the client-side can access it. We have two collections stored on our own database: one corresponding to foods and their ratings and one corresponding to historical comparison data. We generated random numbers to populate our foods collection with votes, for testing purposes.

Looking ahead, we want to implement upvoting and downvoting food items. This has proven difficult because we do not want to compromise performance for database synchronicity. Voting requires pushes to the database, and this can be difficult because there are many places where we want a person's vote to count. We want to restrict the number of votes per person for each food item. We will most likely do this via cookies or localstorage. Finally, we want to start finalizing the look and function of the main page, adding buttons and menu bars so that the user can interact with the page. We also need to start solidifying the mobile design.

* "This has proven difficult because we do not want to compromise performance for database synchronicity." --you shouldn't need to worry about this with most modern database engines.  Don't worry about the performance in this class.
* "this can be difficult because there are many places where we want a person's vote to count. We want to restrict the number of votes per person for each food item" --this is a difficult problem but definitely do it first, note challenges.
