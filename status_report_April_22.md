Backend: We finished implementing the database part of our app, save for a few potential bugs that we think we can catch throughout the development of the front end. We were able to assign unique ID's to users and create a database containing the data for which foods each user has upvoted/downvoted.

Frontend: we have updated the UI to have a more eye-appealing score bar. We also have settled on a tentative design for our site. We want to be able to use Bootstrap and React on the front end, for a higher-quality user experience. Front end frameworks would be the key to improving the UI, and this is our next step. We think that thorough and complete use of both frameworks will be important in developing a good interface.

Overall: we have deployed our app to Heroku (done in advance to start populating the database). We plan on pushing improved versions of the app to Heroku in the future. Furthermore, we plan on using a domain registration service to deploy our app for real in the future.
